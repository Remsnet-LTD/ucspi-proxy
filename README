Version 0.94
2000-10-12

This package contains a proxy program that passes data back and forth
between two connections set up by a UCSPI server and a UCSPI client.

How to install:

- As root, run "make install"

Usage:

The simple usage is:
	UCSPIserver [address] UCSPIclient [address] ucspi-proxy
Replace "UCSPIserver" with the program that will accept connections, and
"UCSPIclient" with the program that will make connections.  See the
"tcp-proxy" script for a TCP-TCP proxy example.

To make the POP3 and IMAP relay proxies work, you may need to edit the
constants at the top of the relay-filter.c file.
